# Hold on, let me explain.
I am 14 years old, and I like to code in JavaScript, C++, and some other languages.<br>You can check out my profile for other programs I've made in C++ like "AutoShell" probably my favorite.
## Regex?
Let me teach you Regex, faster than freeCodeCamp does.<br>Because I hate their multi-step process, they could just explain so I can do it myself.<br>
Characters in regex usually are `[a-z]` or `[A-Z]` for uppercase.<br>Numbers in regex are always `[0-9]`.<br>You can have a set of instructions in regex, like `/[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]/` which would validate a Phone Number.<br>But wait! Thats a long regex string. Lets shorten it. `/[0-9]*-[0-9]*-[0-9]*/` which shortens in by a ton of characters.<br>The global flag `\g` will easily serve what you need by getting ALL instaces of the regex. Say I have "I love cats! Cats are adorable!" `/[c][C]ats/` will get the word "Cats" once. Adding the global flag will get it all times, so `/[c][C]ats/g` will get all instances of cats!<br>Thats all I've learned this far.
## Algorithm?
These are **CLIENT SIDED** algorithms that shouldn't be used on backend.<br>It is extremely unsafe to use a **CLIENT SIDED** algorithm on a backend.<br>I also don't recommend using these on a huge codespace and instead, have error messages from the API itself.
## Where can I learn!
Use [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org/), its the easiest way for me to learn all of this in their Data Structure & Algorithms course.
